## üîß Technologies Used

- **Java** - Core programming language
- **Java Swing** - For creating the graphical user interface
- **MySQL** - Database for storing user data and transactions
- **JDBC** - For database connectivity
- **jcalendar** - For date selection in forms

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- Java JDK 23 or later
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Connector/J 9.4.0
- jcalendar-tz-1.3.3-4.jar
- NetBeans IDE (recommended for development)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/itssoumodip/Java-ATM-Banking-System.git
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   - Create a MySQL database named `bankmanagmentsystem`
   - Update the database connection parameters in the `Conn.java` file if needed
   ```java
   c = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql:///bankmanagmentsystem", "root", "yourpassword");
   ```

3. **Add required libraries**
   - Add MySQL Connector/J to your project
   - Add jcalendar-tz library to your project

4. **Compile and run the application**
   - The entry point is the `Login.java` class

## üìù Database Structure

The system uses a MySQL database with the following main tables:

- **Account**: Stores account details including card number, PIN, and balance
- **Users**: Stores user personal information
- **Transactions**: Records all transaction history

## üß© Project Structure

- **Login.java**: Entry point, handles user authentication
- **SignupOne.java**, **SignupTwo.java**, **SignupThree.java**: Multi-step registration process
- **Transaction.java**: Main dashboard for various banking operations
- **Deposite.java**: Handles deposit functionality
- **Withdrawl.java**: Handles withdrawal functionality
- **checkBalance.java**: For balance inquiries
- **MiniStatement.java**: Shows recent transaction history
- **moneyTransfer.java**: Facilitates funds transfer between accounts
- **PinChange.java**: Allows users to update their PIN
- **Conn.java**: Manages database connections

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Passwords are stored in the database (consider implementing encryption in production)
- The system uses basic SQL queries (implement prepared statements for production to prevent SQL injection)
- Always use secure connection strings in a production environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Implement password hashing for better security
- Add email verification for new accounts
- Implement two-factor authentication
- Add admin dashboard for bank managers
- Improve transaction history with advanced filtering options
